# oppna-program-reklistan-skinny-json

This is a mavenized "fork" of the Skinny Web service from [liferay-plugins](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins). 

The skinny-json service is modified to work with repeatable and nested journal article fields. Earlier versions of these modifications
were sent in a PR to Liferay, but we now doubt that these will get merged since more recently added functionality is probably very
specific to our use case.

This service is used to get all REK data as JSON. It's also used to being able to display the custom preview/diff templates.
